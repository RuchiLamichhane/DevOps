This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps".

The reason for documenting these days is to stay consistent on my learning journey and have something to look back on how far i have come on days when i feel zero to no motivation .I hope it will also help others to take something from it and also hopefully enhance the learning resources.

The goal is to take 100 days, 1 hour each a day, to tackle over 13 areas of "DevOps" to a foundational knowledge.

This will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
